    <div class=“bed”>
        <p>He was a cruel man, a violent man who refused to take accountability for anything in his life. He was always the bitter victim who even after his accident thirteen years prior would not be shaken into admitting he had led a half-life; a life of anger and pessimism. He had always performed every function from the wheelchair that granted him a fraction of his former freedom, so it was incredibly odd to see him lying in a bed. There were no tubes or machines, he could have been sleeping. He was more emaciated than I had ever seen him and the tattoos that covered his arms looked oddly vibrant against his white skin. He looked frail- nothing like my memory of his violence and severity. His evil eyes were closed never to open again. I whispered to him “I am good in spite of you. In spite of you, Dad.”</p>

    <div class=“road”>
        <p>With tears in my eyes, I sauntered away from the hospital knowing I would never see him again. My next stop was my mother’s house. I hadn’t seen her in almost ten years. In a daze, I traveled the curve-filled and hilly country roads, oblivious to the blackberry bushes that as a child pulled me into their thorny embrace. The forest on either side of the road was thick, casting a canopy overhead that nearly suffocated the road of any sunlight. I felt as suffocated as the road despite the air being crisp and cool having yet to be strangled by the mugginess of summer. The sun was cruel; it would have been my preference that it was raining like it was raining in my soul. There was no sound other than the truck that whined in complaint due to the speed of halving a normally four hour drive from Little Rock to Joplin. I hadn’t made it in time to say goodbye to a breathing figure who instilled such fear and sadness. I would not allow another day to go by without saying my piece to my aging mother. </p>

    <div class=“mom”>
        <p>I pulled into the dirt drive and sat for several minutes trying to decide what I would say. But it became settled in my heart that no matter how many times I rehearsed my lines, I would never get them right; there was too much feeling attached to the words. I got out of my bug-littered truck and approached the tiny 900 square foot house. An eternity awaited me as I seemed to knock for far too long. She, too, must have been standing at the door, rehearsing what she would say. She came out, much larger than I had last seen. She still walked like she didn’t have knees. She had the same child-like face, innocent and unassuming. And so began the forgiveness adventure I had been working up to nearly all of my life. </p>

    <div class=“ending”>
        <p>I drove away chasing the sunset and the few good memories I had as a child. I made my way to my aunt’s house, stopping for a pack of smokes and a bottle of tequila. The farm had a large brush pile that my aunt had been saving for a bonfire. My aunt, my uncle the fire chief, and I gathered around the blaze and sat, quietly passing around the tequila. The heat felt good on a cool summer’s evening and helped dry my eyes. I wasn’t crying because I would miss him. I was crying for me and for all that I had overcome in my life. I cried for the violent upbringing, for the numerous taboo abuses that occurred and were left forgotten by everyone but me. I cried for an abrupt start to life, for the child I lost, for never getting the help I needed to be a functional adult. I cried for the silence that I learned to stand through when I shared my life story. I cried because they would never say they were sorry. I cried because no one would ever stand trial for their sin. I cried because in spite of him, I was good, I did the right thing; I showed up despite never having had a single person show up for me. </p>
        <p>I realized I had again lost myself in thought and coming back to the present, let out a large sigh that dominated the silence. At that moment I knew I had made the right choice to make the trip. I had, after all, wavered in my decision to come. My aunt took the sigh as a sign that it was now okay to speak. Face still turned to the flames she said, “Today hasn’t been kind to you. David wasn’t an easy man to be around. What you did today was very noble.” Noble. That word stuck to me. Noble.</p>

    <div class=“noble”>
        <p>Call me Noble. Noble does not hate the world, but rather looks upon the world in all its intersectionalities and complexities with child-like wonder. Noble trusts the words but measures them against their actions. Noble does not hate, but rather sees the world through a lens of love. Noble chooses everyday to overcome the past and break the chains of abuse. Noble does the hard things, like teaching oneself how to be an adult. Noble shows up for people who never show up for them. Noble is good, in spite of him, Noble is good.</p>
