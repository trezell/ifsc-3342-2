                <h2>Predisposed to PTSD</h2>
                <p>I can now recognize that I’ve survived something major and that “after an ordeal like a tornado… people often have trouble sleeping and concentrating, feel jumpy and may be easily startled, or see the disaster replaying in their minds.”- <a href=“https://www.govtech.com/em/disaster/tornadoes-aftermath-puts-some-at-risk-for-ptsd.html”>govtech.com</a> I understand that my symptoms have a name, one of which I am no stranger to.</p> 
                <p>Although I am acquainted with PTSD, this is my first time working through it in real-time, as much of my trauma occured during my youth. This early trauma has put me at a greater risk for developing PTSD. According to <a href=“https://www.physio-pedia.com/Post-traumatic_Stress_Disorder”> physio-pedia </a>“apart from the event itself, risk factors for developing PTSD include: a past history of trauma or previous mental health problems; ongoing stressful life events after the trauma; an absence of social supports; gender (more prevalent in women); childhood adversities.”</p> 
                <p>As a woman with little social support who has mental health problems stemming from childhood adversities and a history of severe trauma, I have a greater risk for developing PTSD.</p>
                <h2>Coping</h2>
                <p>Over the years of recovery from childhood events, I have replaced maladaptive coping mechanisms with positive ones. I know there are healthy and unhealthy ways of coping and I can see myself performing a little of both. I can applaud myself for the good things I am doing while showing myself some grace for the bad things. I am heeding a number of the <a href=“https://www.apa.org/topics/disasters-response/tornadoes”>American Psychological Association’s</a> (APA) recommendations for dealing with PTSD after a tornado. According to the APA it is important to be patient with yourself while you work through your emotions. Another recommendation I am following is to reach out to others by seeking support and/or speaking about your experience. Lastly, I am being physically active and letting off steam that way.</p>
                <p>Not all of my methods for coping have been positive. One in particular is very troubling. Although I am troubled by this coping mechanism, I also know I am not alone in my issues drinking because according to <a href=“https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/related/problem_alcohol_use.asp”>Veterans Affairs</a> “going through a trauma—whether or not you develop PTSD—can lead to alcohol use problems. Up to three quarters of people who survived abuse or violent traumatic events report drinking problems.”</p>
            <section id="va-drinking">                  
                    <p>“You may drink because using alcohol distracts you from your problems for a short time. You should know, though, that drinking makes it harder to concentrate, be productive, and enjoy your life.</p>
                    <p>Using too much alcohol makes it harder to cope with stress and your trauma memories. Alcohol use and intoxication (getting drunk) can increase some PTSD symptoms.</p> 
                    <p>Examples of symptoms that can get worse are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>feeling numb or having no emotions</li>
                            <li>being cut off from others</li>
                            <li>feeling angry and irritable</li>
                            <li>feeling depressed</li>
                            <li>feeling jittery or as if you are always on guard”</li> 
                        </ul>

                <h2>Survivor's Guilt</h2>
                <p>I’ve put a lot of pressure on myself to be okay after the tornado. Mostly, I feel guilty for having PTSD when our home was barely touched. My beautiful Chevy Silverado 4x4 truck, Petra, now has scratches and dents. Our shed that my wife and I built during her battle with cancer was totaled along with its contents, but our house is still habitable. I have felt guilt for having PTSD when we were mostly unscathed. The more I try to be okay the more I am led to drink. The more I drink, the less I hear the rumble and then the popping, the less I feel the pressure and then the silence. The more I drink, the more I am outside, and the less time I am in quiet darkness remembering the humidity as the sweat poured from my nervous body as it remained crouched, hands welded to the door that wouldn’t stay shut.</p>
                <section id="guilt">
                    <p>“Some people may also experience ‘survivor’s guilt,’ which is when you feel guilty that the disaster didn’t affect you as severely as others. Specifically, you may feel guilty that you lived when others did not or that your property was undamaged while others suffered serious damage. These feelings can include exaggerated beliefs about your ability to predict the outcome or feelings of wrongdoing on your part. These feelings can increase the severity of other symptoms of distress following the event.” <a href=“http://extension.msstate.edu/publications/coping-grief-after-disaster”> -MSState.edu</a></p>

            <div class="ending-2">
                <p>I am not only suffering from the PTSD of a close call with Mother Nature, I am suffering from survivor’s guilt. It’s been ten days and the PTSD is getting better, as are my chosen coping methods, but it is being replaced by survivor’s guilt. I will try to remember “it’s a good idea to simply acknowledge it and call it what it is because it doesn’t go away if one represses these feelings. It’s not about healing the guilt so much as it is about shifting one’s perspective, and the passage of time can help immensely.” <a href=“https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-empowerment-diary/201801/what-everybody-should-know-about-survivors-guilt”>-Psychology Today.</a>

                <h2>Grief</h2>
                <p>Twenty-three days after the tornado, just as my grief was waning, I lost my best friend. We came home on Saturday, April 22nd to find my beloved dog Foxy quite confused and very sick. We took her to the emergency vet who kept her overnight. Her liver enzymes were ridiculously high and she couldn’t even keep water down. The next morning, at 7:39 a.m. I received a call from the vet who had figured out Foxy’s problem. She had two massive tumors, one on each lobe of her liver. She was confused because the toxins had built up due to her failing and probably cancerous liver. The vet told us she could not survive because they could not remove that much of her liver and more than likely it was cancer and had probably spread by that point. We made the difficult decision to put her down. By 10:00 a.m. I said goodbye to my girl. My wife and I sang our little diddy to her, although she didn’t appear to recognize us, she recognized her song and went to sleep blissfully knowing she had been loved.</p>

                </article>
                <p>Although the tornado did not destroy our home, our home has been devastated. The roof is gone and it won’t stop raining. I do not have enough buckets for the tears we have and continue to shed. Shattered rafters now block every sofa she once rested on. Although her bedding has now been washed and neatly folded, there is a film of dirt on the many beds where she once dreamed of running through fields and catching young rabbits. The floors of my office are made sharp and jagged by the fractured hardwood that mourns the clicking sounds emanating from the nails on her paws. The sofa that resides in my office no longer has cushions. It is useless without her lazing about while I peck away at my computer.</p>
                <p>My home, where I spend 99% of my time, is no longer habitable. It is a hostile mess that is only fit for mourning. She had a presence in every room of the house. There are memories dripping down the walls. Echos of her last days appear to me in window reflections and the creaks and pops of the house. I look for her at every turn only to be obliterated when I realize she won’t ever again be a footstep behind me.</p>
                <p>Houses are being rebuilt in my neighborhood but I dare say mine will always be beyond repair. A week after the tornado I began to feel survivor’s guilt. It felt selfish to be suffering. But now I will be a selfish wreck of a person. I am entitled to this grief. My heart will never be the same. In memory of the best dog ever. She came to us as a rescue on August 12, 2016, and left us on April 23, 2023.</p>
