        <h2>[Saturday]</h2>
        <p>We went to Walmart to get some ice for our cooler, some charcoal, and some new flashlights. When we got home we raked the backyard and swept off the patio. After we were done my wife started the grill and I started drinking. I was still on edge and the beer was helping to calm my nerves.</p>
        <h2>[Sunday]</h2>
        <p>We skip church and tend to the front yard. We raked it as best as we could and saw to the mammoth Sturbridge Community pool cover that was swept into our raised garden bed. I got a box cutter and cut it into eight three by ten foot sections. We carried it all to the street and placed it on top of the remaining pieces of our shed and fence. She started the grill again and I started drinking again. That evening around seven, power on our side of the street was restored.</p>
        <h2>[Monday]</h2>
        <p>More and more trucks and heavy machinery line the streets making Old Forge essentially a single laned road. The noise is still thick and hard to bear. My wife takes the day off from work. She spends it cleaning the house while I work outside. I get out my pickaxe and take all my anxiety out on the dirt in our flower bed. I cart ten wheelbarrows of dirt before calling it a day. She grills again and I drink again. I started talking about my experience more. The shock started to wear off and I came to realize how close we came to losing everything and how close I came to being sucked up with our belongings.</p>
        <h2>[Tuesday]</h2>
        <p>They said the weather was supposed to get bad again. I reached out to a friend and cried for most of the morning. I was bound up with fear so I decided to dig out my pickaxe again. This time I took my anxiety out on a cubic foot root system I had been trying to dig up the past five years since moving in. I he-manned that old tree right out of the ground and it took every ounce of strength I had. My muscles were screaming but I couldn’t stop there. I grabbed the pruning shears and took out the small tree of my neighbors that she wanted rid of. I planned to attack those roots too but soon realized I had become a wet noodle. But I just couldn’t stop. So I tore down the rest of the mangled fence and hauled it to the street. I’ve realized that I’m not liking being indoors and I’m not sure why. I think it reminds me of being in that claustrophobic closet all hot and sweaty and in the dark. I poured myself a stout drink since I am alone and there is no one to judge me. I finish it outside and come in to take a shower. </p>
