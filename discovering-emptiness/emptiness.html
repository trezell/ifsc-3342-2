                A dark doorway opens wide before me, revealing a strange but familiar wilderness.
            </div>
            <p>The wilderness gives birth to a lonely and nearly naked Emptiness who begins to dance around me, her black velvet cape twirling, as she beckons me to follow. Succumbing to the melancholic descant, I stumble hypnotized out of the clean porcelain box from which I am currently sprawled and enter into the dirty depths of my mind. Emptiness cries out for me to extinguish my firelight and join her by the riverside where the spirits of madness roam freely. Like magic, I am stripped of all hope as the familiar suffocating feeling settles over this gorge of darkness in which I am now a willing prisoner. I sit in the cold mud deep within the valley, the valley that exists only in my mind, for my body, is actually crumpled on the bathroom floor. Emptiness looks at my deep blue veins and cries out for homage. She yearns for something to make her feel alive, so she screams to be painted red but I cannot. It has been nearly ten years since I have crafted a weapon in this bush and provided for her the panacea she most craves. If she doesn’t quiet soon I will drink her into oblivion.</p>
            <div class="arm">
                <img src="img/arm.png">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="empty2">
            <div class="empty2-1">
                <p>I rise from the bathroom floor, wearing the cape of Emptiness, and stare at the mirror disconcerted by the reflection. I search the image for the faintest sense of familiarity. Reading her face like a map, I follow the lines on this person’s forehead hoping to trigger any memory that would put me in this body. The lines make three mountain ranges that stretch as far east and west as her canvas-like skin can contain. Southward lies the brows, coarse, unruly, and bedraggled by the elements. They furrow, making brave yet unsuccessful attempts to meet, similar to soulmates who pivot like magnets on opposite ends of the earth; bound to yearn for but never to touch.</p>
                <p>I can’t look her in those eyes, those eyes that stretch past the horizon and into space, so I settle my sights further south. In the middle of this map, there is a forty-degree slope that leads to two cave systems whose entrances make a prominent and chunky letter “M”. I name the caves Machiavelli and Masochist before moving on through the scattered fields of bluestem grass mustache that have collapsed and slid down to form the edges of a great basin. From the banks of the jowl-sagging mudslide, I find myself looking at the epicenter of all this destruction; two lips, one the last remaining vices used to quiet Emptiness.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="empty2-2">
                <p>I take a deep breath and gaze upon myself once more. I can see it in my eyes, my desire to make Emptiness go away. My old friends' self-harm, food, hydrocodone, and pot are long gone and so I am stuck with my remaining two options: Tequila or working out. With little warning, I slam my hands onto the marble vanity, vexed by my limited options. How I wish I could curl up beside Emptiness with a bottle of hydrocodone but I’m in Recovery and it bloody well pisses me off! “Recovery.” I laugh because I’m not an addict, I lie. “Recovery” but Tequila is still legal until it becomes a problem. It’s not yet a problem.</p> 
                <p>“Let’s not make it a problem,” I say, giving in to the notion of movement. I turn away from Emptiness, though she still ambles close behind me, and make my way to my wardrobe and change into my workout clothing. From my dresser, I pull out my black Under Armour basketball shorts and a bright orange off-brand racerback. Sitting on the unmade bed I slip on a pair of orange SmartWool socks before heading into the kitchen to fill up a sixty-four-ounce aqua flip-top water bottle.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Once in my home gym, I slip on my Hoka running shoes and hook up the Bluetooth sound system to my phone. I open Spotify and pass by my typical dance gym mix choosing instead to listen to my playlist full of artists like In This Moment, Lacuna Coil, and Butcher Babies. They play songs like “Blood,” “Trip the Darkness,” and “Dead Man Walking,” all adequate expressions of my current emotional state. With my music well in hand, I mount my stationary bicycle and let the music fuel me as I ravage my body.</p>
                <p>Aggression drips from the words <q><span id=“blood”>blood, blood, blood, pump mud through my veins, shut your dirty, dirty mouth, I’m not that easy</q></span> and chokes me as the guitar screams and the angry woman from In This Moment screeches out her woes from behind the speaker. I let her rage fill me as I pump my legs up and down in hot pursuit of that searing burn. My hands make tight fists around the handlebars until my knuckles are devoid of color and begin to ache. I don’t need to look at my instruments to know I am sustaining fifteen miles per hour because I can feel my sides moaning from exertion and I know that indisputable stitch is soon in coming. Time seems to vanish and before I know it I have ridden eight miles.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="empty3">
            <p>My pace begins to slow as my rage gives way to sorrow. As if telepathically linked, my playlist shifts and the music begins to slow. The lyrics of a song I don’t remember the name of speak about being weak and I feel a crushing wave wash over me as my legs barely push the pedals. Allowing the words to fill me, I hand over my power to Emptiness as my tears mix with sweat, creating a mystical brew that conjures her into her full hollowed-out form. Lording over me, she begins to whisper, faintly at first but growing louder, that there is only one way out of this. I must end it. I follow the trail she leaves me and change my playlist to the one I’ve entitled simply “rest.” Soon, Michael Andrews’s rendition of “Mad World” fills my spirit.</p>
            <p>I stop cycling less than half a mile from my ten-mile goal and collapse onto the carpet. Having sobbed until there were no tears left, my face is left chapped and dry as if I were on my third day lost in the Gobi desert. I surrender to this place of desperation, to this desert of timeless wandering where there is nothing to cling to, for everything slips through your fingers like sand. My eyes, scorched by the sun of my sorrow, feel thick and heavy and desire to close and never open. However, I know I will live to see tomorrow, for those days of fighting for an early end remain in my past alone, and so I swat the thought away like an unwanted advance. I stretch out on the scalding carpet of sand and imagine myself never having to feel her again. I try to imagine what a life without Emptiness would feel like. Or, a life where I didn’t have to shake her toxic aurora nearly every day. I just can’t figure out why I can’t make her disappear. I try to think back to a time before her and I come up empty. She has simply always been.</p>
            <p>The carpet clings to me like a second skin as I once again find myself falling prey to intrusive thoughts. A solitary shiver runs through my core as I find myself fourteen again. I am sitting alone in my room, rocking gently back and forth with cave-fish eyes that have no need for light. I exist in a world of my own making and am guided through the jagged, rocky landscapes by memories and feelings. I follow them blindly, like a rat to a flute, until I reach the deep cave systems where I frequently hide. There is nothing here but Emptiness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="empty4">
            <p>I think back to a time when I first became cognizant of her presence. Emptiness had a knack for showing up during periods of intense pain, and for me, my pain was amplified by the surging hormones of puberty. Puberty is never easy, even for the most stable of teenagers. It was a particularly trying time for me not only because I was already unstable due to childhood trauma but because it was also when I learned about self-harm from a school library book.</p>
            <p>At fourteen, Emptiness commanded more and more of my attention. It became obvious that she didn’t belong and there must have been something wrong with me. I had asked my mother to make an appointment so I could talk to someone but she claimed she didn’t know how to find the right people to help me. More accurately, she didn’t want the family secrets to come out and above all else, she didn’t want to be implicated as a source of my trauma. The more she refused to help me, the more frequent Emptiness appeared and the more desperate I became to make her go away.</p>
            <p>When I found the book entitled “Cut” in my school library, I read it in one sitting. After I finished, I decided to try something new. I stole an X-acto blade from art class and made the journey back to the cave where Emptiness sat waiting. I made my first minor cut across my left forearm. I hated the pain but Emptiness became excited at the sight of my blood and demanded more.</p>
            <p>Eventually, my blade grew dull and I was forced to graduate to a blade I had carefully extracted from a Schick razor. We were at the height of our love affair as blood rained from the thin slivers I now expertly etched. I became enamored with the soft pink scars left behind and began to see them as a sort of trophy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="empty5">
            <p>People began to take notice when I was still wearing long sleeves in one-hundred-degree Oklahoma heat but I didn’t care. I still held out hope that if the right person took notice I might get someone to tell me how to make this ache go away. The closest I came to getting help was when a classmate's mother came to our house and spoke to my mother about the CD her daughter requested I burn for her. It’s that conversation that haunts me as I sit in this all too familiar cave now.</p>
            <p>I returned home as I would any other day but before I could retreat to my cave my mother stopped me and demanded a conversation. The words from her hurtful mouth entangled themselves around me and followed me to my room and to my blade. We crawled into my cave,  I donned my cave-fish eyes and drifted into Emptiness. Alone in the dark amphitheater-like cavern, I hear my mother’s words echoing through the chambers. “She’s too far gone,” hangs in the stagnant places within. Her words leave red gashes across my arm. My heart breaks as Emptiness cradles me while I rage against my flesh. My head voice screams that this time I will cut the right way; I will cut with the vein. I make a red hair-like cut down my forearm but find that veins are much deeper and harder to penetrate. This realization leaves a bitterness that is only satiated with thirty quick-succession slashes. The feelings I cannot handle leak from me and I am left alone with Emptiness.</p>
            <p>I was frequently alone with Emptiness, because I had only one person who gave a damn about me back then. My step-grandfather, who we called Poppy, genuinely loved me but I couldn’t see him as often as I liked. And so, from that point on, Emptiness and the belief that I was too far gone, were my only companions, which further implied I wouldn’t amount to anything if I even survived my adolescence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="empty6">
            <p>Swallowing hard the grit from the sandy carpet, I now realize how far I’ve come from those days of believing I was too far gone. It took me twenty years to be capable of healing some of the internal scars my mother’s words have left on me yet the physical ones still remain. The self-harm scars are aged and faded but are still prominent reminders I wish I could hide. Emptiness also remains, though we are no longer friends. I now have someone to hold me when nightmares come or when emotions become too much to bear. I now have someone who leaves me daily reminders that I am never too far gone and so Emptiness no longer serves a purpose. She is no longer necessary. Again I am struck by the question as to why she won’t just leave me alone. And then it hits me.</p>
            <p>A realization booms from within me, striking me violently, and my world spins as I begin to see stars. I draw in a sharp breath as understanding begins to sink in. With a shaky hand, I reach for Emptiness and pull back the hood of her cape. A single tear falls down my face as I see a small girl standing shyly before me. Her head is tilted down in shame but her eyes, forever hopeful, look up at me through her long, silky lashes. I recognize the chunky “M” shaped nose centered above a great pink basin of lips. She is me. She is the part of me that has protected me my entire life and she has only ever known darkness and sadness. She is the person who stepped forward to endure what I could not.</p>  
            <p>All these years, I should have cradled you, my sweet Emptiness. I should have told you that I would never leave you and that I would never let anyone hurt you ever again. Instead, I tried everything I could to banish you. “This ends today,” I tell her. I take Tasha’s little hand in mine and draw her into a hug. “From now on, we will walk this life together, hand in hand,” I promise myself, as Emptiness, now named, blends into the innermost corners of my heart.</p>

            </div>
            <p><span id="empty-end">With this new peace, I find myself steadfast in my desire to overpower old beliefs and battle scars. I decided to get a large tattoo across my forearm that covers my self-harm scars. It reads “you are never too far gone” above a field of poppies. I chose poppies to honor the one man who loved me as a child. At almost one week old, my tattoo is still healing, just as I am. In two weeks' time, I will go back to add in full color and my scars will completely disappear, being replaced by words of affirmation that I was never and will never be too far gone.</p></span>
