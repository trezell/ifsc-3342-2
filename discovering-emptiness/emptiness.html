            <p>A dark doorway opens wide before me, revealing a strange but familiar wilderness. The wilderness gives birth to a lonely and nearly naked Emptiness who begins to dance around me, her black velvet cape twirling, as she beckons me to follow. Succumbing to the melancholic descant, I stumble hypnotized out of the clean porcelain box from which I am currently sprawled and enter into the dirty depths of my mind. Emptiness cries out for me to extinguish my firelight and join her by the riverside where the spirits of madness roam freely. Like magic, I am stripped of all hope as the familiar suffocating feeling settles over this gorge of darkness in which I am now a willing prisoner. I sit in the cold mud deep within the valley, the valley that exists only in my mind, for my body is actually crumpled on the bathroom floor. Emptiness looks at my deep blue veins and cries out for homage. She yearns for something to make her feel alive, so she screams to be painted <strong><span style="color: red">red</span></strong> but I cannot. It has been nearly ten years since I have crafted a weapon in this bush and provided for her the panacea she most craves. If she doesn’t quiet soon I will drink her into oblivion.</p>
                <div class="arm">

                </div>
            <p>I rise from the bathroom floor, wearing the cape of Emptiness, and stare at the mirror disconcerted by the reflection. I search the image for the faintest sense of familiarity. Reading her face like a map, I follow the lines on this person’s forehead hoping to trigger any memory that would put me in this body. The lines make three mountain ranges that stretch as Far East and West as her canvas-like skin can contain. Southward lies the brows, coarse, unruly, and bedraggled by the elements. They furrow, making brave yet unsuccessful attempts to meet, similar to soulmates who pivot like magnets on opposite ends of the earth; bound to yearn for but never to touch. </p>
            <p>I can’t look her in those eyes, those eyes that stretch past the horizon and into space, so I settle my sights further south. In the middle of this map there is a forty degree slope that leads to two cave systems whose entrances make a prominent and chunky letter ‘M’. I name the caves Machiavelli and Masochist before moving on through the scattered fields of bluestem grass that have collapsed and slid down to form the edges of a great basin. From the banks of the jowl-sagging mudslide I find myself looking at the epicenter of all this destruction; two lips, the last remaining vice to quiet Emptiness.</p>
            <p>I take a deep breath and gaze upon myself once more. I can see it in my eyes, my desire to make Emptiness go away. My old friends self-harm, food, hydrocodone, and pot are long gone and so I am stuck with my remaining two options: Tequila or working out. With little warning I slam my hands onto the marble vanity, vexed by my limited options. How I wish I could curl up beside Emptiness with a bottle of hydrocodone but I’m in Recovery and it bloody well pisses me off! “Recovery.” I laugh because I’m not an addict, I lie. “Recovery” but Tequila is still legal, until it becomes a problem. It’s not yet a problem. </p>
            <p>“Let’s not make it a problem,” I say, giving in to the notion of movement. I turn away from Emptiness, though she still ambles close behind me, and make my way to my wardrobe and change into my workout clothing. From my dresser I pull out my black Under Armour basketball shorts and a bright orange off-brand racerback. Sitting on the unmade bed I slip on a pair of orange SmartWool socks before heading into the kitchen to fill up a sixty-four ounce aqua flip-top water bottle.</p> 
            <p>Once in my home gym, I slip on my Hoka running shoes and hook up the Bluetooth sound system to my phone. I open Spotify and pass by my typical dance gym mix choosing instead to listen to my playlist full of artists like In This Moment, Lacuna Coil, and Butcher Babies. They play songs like “Blood,” “Trip the Darkness,” and “Dead Man Walking,” all adequate expressions of my current emotional state. With my music well in hand, I mount my stationary bicycle and let the music fuel me as I ravage my body.</p>

            <p>Aggression drips from the words “blood, blood, blood, pump mud through my veins, shut your dirty, dirty mouth, I’m not that easy” and chokes me as the guitar screams and the angry woman from In This Moment screeches out her woes from behind the speaker. I let her rage fill me as I pump my legs up and down in hot pursuit of that searing burn. My hands make tight fists around the handlebars until my knuckles are devoid of color and begin to ache. I don’t need to look at my instruments to know I am sustaining seventeen miles per hour because I can feel my sides moaning from exertion and I know that indisputable stitch is soon in coming. Time seems to vanish and before I know it I have ridden eight miles.</p> 
            <p>My pace begins to slow as my rage gives way to sorrow. As if telepathically linked, my playlist shifts and the music begins to slow. The lyrics of a song I don’t remember the name of speaks about being weak and I feel a crushing wave wash over me as my legs barely push the pedals. Allowing the words to fill me, I hand over my power to Emptiness as my tears mix with sweat, creating a mystical brew that conjures her into her full hollowed-out form. Lording over me, she begins to whisper, faintly at first but growing louder, that there is only one way out of this. I must end it. I follow the trail she leaves me and change my playlist to the one I’ve entitled simply “rest.” Soon, Michael Andrews’s rendition of “Mad World” fills my spirit. </p>
            <p>I stop cycling less than half a mile of my ten mile goal and collapse onto the carpet. Having sobbed until there were no tears left, my face is left chapped and dry as if I were on my third day lost in the Gobi desert. I surrender to this place of desperation, to this desert of timeless wandering where there is nothing to cling to, for everything slips through your fingers like sand. My eyes, scorched by the sun of my sorrow, feel thick and heavy and desire to close and never open. However, I know I will live to see tomorrow, for those days of fighting for an early end remain in my past alone, and so I swat the thought away like an unwanted advance. I stretch out on the scalding carpet of sand and imagine myself never having to feel her again. I try to imagine what a life without Emptiness would feel like. Or, a life where I didn’t have to shake her toxic aurora nearly every day. I just can’t figure out why I can’t make her disappear. I try to think back to a time before her and I come up empty. She has simply always been.</p>  
            <p>A realization booms from within me, striking me violently, and my world spins as I begin to see stars. I draw in a sharp breath as understanding begins to sink in. With a shaky hand I reach for Emptiness and pull back the hood of her cape. A single tear falls down my face as I see a small girl standing shyly before me. Her head is tilted down in shame but her eyes, forever hopeful, look up at me through her lashes. I recognize the chunky “M” shaped nose centered above a great pink basin of lips. She is me. She is the part of me that has protected me my entire life and she has only ever known darkness and sadness. She is the person who stepped forward to endure what I could not. </p> 
            <p>All these years, I should have cradled you, my sweet Emptiness. I should have told you that I would never leave you and that I would never let anyone hurt you ever again. Instead I tried everything I could to banish you. “This ends today,” I tell her. I take Tasha’s little hand in mine and draw her into a hug. “From now on, we will walk this life together, hand in hand,” I promise myself, as Emptiness, now named, fades into the ether. </p>
