    <div class=“pit”>
        <p>The deeply buried feelings within have been brought to the surface. The past circles like a hawk searching for prey. Falling victim to my emotion, I allow myself to flutter for my last breath of freedom before being cast down as a meal for time. Something bursts free from within and I feel my stomach plummet to the ground beneath me. I let out a scream, not out of desperation but out of defeat. Lacking a battle cry, I give into the bloodless cold; the darkness has me now. I fall through emptiness, grasping at nothing but internal straws. Maybe this is it, I tell myself. As I fall into the grave below, I posit that perhaps this time will be the last time I see the bottom of this pit. Maybe this time I will discover some unknown source for healing and I will never again need to journey to the center of the earth. The world seems so small and alien from these depths. Everyone’s problems seem so insignificant compared to the pain I am currently in. Oh God, it’s hard to be selfless from here. </p>
        <p>Familiar with the bounds of my pit I begin to dance a dance of aggrieved aggression. I thrash my body from one end of the pit to the other. My limbs take outlandish forms while the lightning keeps time with the beat of my undulation. My thighs make thunder as I brandish my calves like whales wielding pocket knives. I taunt the tear-soaked sky with my naked-crazed smile and lose myself to become beholden to the shadow times. Dancing my way through history, I see myself as a small child: tiny, fragile, and needy. I become trapped there, in those walls of that house, on George Washington Avenue. </p>
    </div>
    <div class=“house”>
        <p>The cramped cardboard box we called home had few windows and even fewer rooms. From the front, the house was a short rectangle whose entrance was at the center. My mother’s room was at the front of the house, just off the tiny dungeon-like living room, and was barely large enough for her queen-size waterbed. In the large front window of her room was a massive industrial fan that had been donated by the owner of the home we rented. The fan, which looked more like something from a large airplane, came from the small newspaper company he also owned and where my mother once worked. On the other side of the living room was the dollhouse-sized kitchen. It contained an old coil cooktop, a short refrigerator, a single sink, and an old fashioned 1950’s dinette with seating for three. My bedroom stretched the length of the house, contained the washer, dryer, and back door, and was joined to the rest of the house by the bathroom. The bathroom was no bigger than a closet. A person could wash their hands while still seated on the toilet and there was barely enough room to open the small cupboard beneath the sink. The bathroom was the only room in the house with a door and it couldn’t be classified as a door since it did not have a knob. Its lock was well out of reach for me and was a simple eye-hook latch that could be unlocked from the outside if one had a credit card or knife. We had a small concrete patio out back and a squatty covered front porch, just the right size for a small wooden porch swing. <p>
        <div class=“house-img”>/*====HOUSE DRAWING HERE====*/</div>
        <p>The front porch was the only place I felt safe then. It was the only place at home that was untainted by violence. When the skies grew dark and lightning reached through the sky, like my heart whose main mission was to stretch its veins out seeking love, we would pour two glasses of sweet tea, and my mother and I would sit sheltered through the summer storm. We would swing gently with the breeze and quietly dream of a world where we were loved instead of hunted, where women and little girls could exist without the savagery of men. We would swing, my small body curled under her warm arms, and watch the lightning spider across the sky. I was never afraid on the porch. The storms were never something to fear, but rather, something to admire. Its fierceness and freedom were untainted by the anger and jealousy of man and I was never afraid. But then again, he was never on the porch. </p>
    </div>
        <div class=“parents”>
            <p>Nothing about him made men afraid. He was of average height, had average looks, and an average build. He wasn’t too thin or too fat; he was merely average. Nothing about him was special, not his intellect, not his strength, and certainly not his love. His brawny cheeks had pores that looked like they could devour me whole, although they always stayed clean. He had a well kept beard that he never shaved. In fact, I have never seen him bare faced and clean shaven. He smelled of ivory soap and hard liquor. If drunkenness could be obtained by vapors, one could become black-out drunk by a mere embrace from him, that is, if he were capable of such a display of affection. I grew up knowing there would always be crown royal bags hidden throughout the house, oftentimes containing a plastic baggie of marijuana, rolling papers, and a “roach clip”. But the worst thing I ever found was a glove box full of dirty needles and a foil pouch containing amphetamines, or, as he called it, speed. He made me promise not to tell my mother. </p>
            <p>My mother was a stunning woman. She was tall, slender yet muscular, and her skin always had a dusty olive tint. She wore makeup that made her eyelashes twice their normal size and left behind a floral aroma as she graced the earth. She was an addict too, that’s how she got so much done. She secretly took her speed on schedule, as if it were prescribed with written instructions by a doctor. She housed many secrets. She looked normal on the outside but there was much hidden behind her broken smile. She endured severe child abuse which left her with learning deficits so severe she was placed in special education classes. She grew into an uneducated and unhealthy adult with faulty coping mechanisms and lots of baggage. </p>
        </div>
    <div class=“hall-intro”>
        <p>Typically, when the voices started to rise and the spit began to froth and fly, I would make my way to the bathroom where I would hide under the vanity sink. The small cabinet would hug my senses in darkness and I would plunge my little fingers into my little ears and escape from the violence that threatened me from outside the door. I would curl up in the fetal position and let the portal carry me far, far above it all where I would helplessly watch over the little girl hiding beneath the bathroom sink. Sometimes, when I couldn’t make it to my protective little hall, my mother would yell at me to go to the neighbor’s house and wait for her to come and get me. I hated it at the neighbor’s house. The neighbor woman had two children a few years older than me who were developmentally delayed. Despite how much time I spent there, I never truly learned how to play with them. Their version of play was warped and the only rules it seemed to follow were that Bobby would always need to win. But what I hated more than anything were the predawn drop offs. My mother had an early shift at Sunbeam, the factory that stole more than it gave, and would leave me at the neighbors house around three in the morning. I hated it because I was forced to sleep on the floor, as the couch was often taken up by a snoring, sheet-covered Bobby, and it wasn’t uncommon for me to have to lay in dog mess, my coat my only warmth. If I weren’t already unpopular because everyone in my small town knew my parents and knew that we were white trash, I would have been unpopular because my goodwill clothes reeked of dog urine. But then again, traumatized kids are almost always lonely. </p>
    </div> 
    <div class=“brothers”>
        <p>Although I was a lonely child, I wasn’t an only child. In fact, I had two older brothers. They were 13 and 15 years older than me. Our middle sibling, Jason, hated our mother and rarely came around. Our eldest brother, Jonathan, didn’t come around much either but when he did, it was always fun and games, at least for him. Something about terrifying me brought him tremendous joy so it wasn’t atypical to see him jumping out from around corners, or jumping down from trees just inches from my next step. Neither was it atypical of him to play jokes on me, like the Christmas he wrapped all my gifts in several layers of duct tape, or the time he gave me soap disguised as white chocolate. He was my favorite brother. </p>
    </div>
    <div class=“wedding”>
        <p>On the day of my favorite brother’s wedding, I was trapped in the middle, unable to run to the neighbors and unable to hide in my portal beneath the sink. I don’t remember much of the wedding. I know I was the flower girl but I don’t remember picking out my dress, or the rehearsal, or the ceremony for that matter. But I remember coming home. Coming home has been etched in my mind like a good tattoo, never fading, still vibrant years later. Coming home in our van, strapped into my seat next to her, I watched as the lines of worry returned to my mother’s face as she flew through the streets. “I knew we shouldn’t have gone to see your brother’s new house afterwards, we are so late,” she said, her voice cracking from fear. My hands gripped tightly to my seatbelt not because I was afraid of her speeding but because I was afraid of what awaited us. I sensed her fear and matched it with my own. Our fears melded together in solidarity and there was comfort there not having to be fearful alone. As we grew nearer, my heart began to imitate the flight of the van that would carry us to the inescapable dungeon of despair that we called home; the home where my mother and I were forsaken by the world and by God. </p>
        <p>With a shaky hand my mother reached for the doorknob, took a breath and slowly opened the door. Before it had been opened fully, I heard the rocking recliner swing back against the wall with a thud so loud it had to have left a hole in the drywall behind it. In one instant my mother was standing beside me and in the next she was a foot off the floor. It happened so quickly I didn’t see how she got from the door to the wall. Submissive to his rage, he latched onto her neck, neither giving her oxygen nor the blood that tried in vain to make its way to her brain, and he fought in his anger to keep a grasp of the life he held within his hands. All was quiet except for the choking sounds emanating from my mother’s breathless body. An empty sucking sound hung in the air as I watched her face turn from red to purple to blue. Her ballerina legs danced the nutcracker while her hands clawed in vain against his iron grip. She was caught helpless, her mouth making foreign shapes as her eyes went bloodshot and began to bulge from their sockets. They looked like small glass Christmas tree baubles hanging precariously from her fern-like eyebrows, that would catch every glimmer of light as if seeing the world for the last time. </p>
        <div class=“eyes-img”>/*====EYES IMG HERE====*/</div> 
        <p>Even at ten I knew what death looked like. I saw it almost every weekend, sometimes more. I had dialed 9-1-1 more than anyone should have to. I knew what death looked like and she was approaching it quickly. Without thinking, and with all the force I could muster, I jumped onto one of my father’s arms. I hung there like a turtle waiting for thunder; I hung on for dear life until his arm began to tire. That was the first day my father’s cold black eyes turned to me. Still in his rage and with his superhuman strength, he flung me against the wall like I was nothing. Although my little frame was rattled and I was bruised, hearing her gasp for survival filled me with courage and I leapt again onto his arm. Finding my little voice for the first time I shouted “Daddy, stop it! Stop it! Stop it!!!” Time slowed down as I compelled my little hands to cling tempestuously to his arm and I watched as my mother’s face began to turn purple again. </p>
        <p>That was the first time that my mother and I worked together to save her life. We repeated the process, my jump onto his arm, his shoving me to the ground, her quick and automatic gasp for air, his hand returning to her throat, and my jump, until he finally tired. As suddenly as it started and without a word, he stopped strangling her and stomped out the front door. My mother was still coughing and wheezing as he peeled out of the driveway, spraying our flying van with gravel. Bruised but undefeated, I made my way to my mothers arms where we sat together in silence, her returning to life as I returned to my hall where I could watch my life take form from the shelter of a detached reality. </p>
        <p>Most of my memories of my childhood are like that. They are memories as if I had observed my life from somewhere outside of myself. They are the result of complex and consistent trauma and they have left me with a deep void within. Even now as an adult I feel like a hollow shell. I am nothing more than an external observation of a life beyond my control. If we are a conglomerate of memories, if that is what makes us a person, then I am not a person but a hall. </p>
    </div>
    <div class=“hall”>
        <p>I am an abandoned hall of paint chipping, concrete slipping, structure crumbling, long forgotten walls. There are pieces missing from the edges and I am empty of anything useful, my past portrayed as spray-painted graffiti on my outermost shell. There are strewn desks, dirty books, and time-erased chalkboards within. I was abandoned in a hurry and forgotten by all but time. I am radioactive and nothing blooms within me, or at least, nothing prospers. Surely, I have been overcome by nature. The urge to eat, to breathe, to defecate, mostly to eat, but I remain hollow. No matter how much food I eat, still hollow.</p>
    <div class=“hall-img”>/*=======INPUT CHERNOBYL DRAWING HERE======*/</div>
        <p>I am trapped in these halls. Out of fear, I never leave. But what kind of person would want to stay? What kind of person wouldn’t sweep up the dirt, wash the curtains, and restore the library? The damaged kind, the filthy kind, the lazy kind. The type of person I am. Working through my issues is harder some days and these are the words I tell myself. That it’s okay that I never leave the house - I am an empty hall. It’s okay that sometimes all I do in a day is make the bed - I am a wounded soul. Some days are harder than others but still, I never leave the hall.</p>
    </div>
    <div class=“whispers”>
        <p>After I’ve sat pensive for a year, my head is full of everything and yet I have nothing to show for it. So much time wasted. So much energy absconded the moment I wake. Time is of short supply and yet somehow I give it freely to the breeze floating whispers that squeeze through the cracks and through the paneless windows of this damaged hall. The whispers vary by the day and the degree of light it brings. On dark days the whispers taint me with words like useless, embarrassing, pathetic, stupid, and sociopath. On bright days the whispers fill me with words like love, possibility, hope, care, and faith.</p> 
        <p>They were familiar only to me: the whispers I could hear in rapid echoes as I danced, crackles that merged like a choir of fire around the empty chambers; the whimsical twitters of their melodies I could bask in plainly within the dirty hall, sounds that emerged violently from the depths within my skull; the lingering emotions from the corners of my mouth, all so desperate, each so terrifying; their quiet little murmurs: the whispers. The whispers remind me of times past. They are as lyrical as the forceful “f” words painted on my shell. They keep me frozen in this tundra of a hall that emanates from within but exists as a space outside myself. A space where emotions are but murmurs of the past and where the past is contained within my bosom where it rests in stillness before launching its next hawk-like attack. </p>
