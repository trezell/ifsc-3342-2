            <p>Love: Any bad weather?</p>
            <span class="time-right">Friday 2:10</span>
        </div>
        <span id="lone">I don’t respond to my wife's text. I am grabbing my helmet and dog and getting us into our pantry closet as the sirens and my phone blare their warnings.</span>
        <h2>[Friday 2:25]</h2>
        <span id="tornado">People talk about the tornado sounding like a freight train. I wouldn’t call it a freight train exactly. To me it sounded more like low bass getting louder as it approached. There was a rumble to it, a chaotic static-like rumble that occurred without notice. My dog and I were huddled in our closet shelter. She was sprawled lazily on the floor as I was crouched, hands laced around the closet doorknob. The roar grew louder when suddenly I felt this intense pressure. I felt as if I were in a vacuum. It was a whole body experience. We lost power as I began to hear popping noises and then the pressure became so intense I couldn’t hear anymore. I was deaf and blind and could only feel the house being pulled at. And then, like magic, it was gone. The pressure was gone, all sound was gone, all power was gone, and I was left stunned in the closet, hands still welded to the door knob. There was no doubting what had just happened.</span>

        </div>
        <span id="lone">I had no idea what awaited me outside. I stayed in my closet for several minutes, afraid of it circling back and finishing the job.</span>
        <div class="text-me">
            <p>Me: Still hiding in closet</p>
            <span class="time-left">Friday 2:36</span>
        </div>
        <span id="lone">I emerge shortly after to find damage all around me. My next door neighbors had a gigantic pine fall onto their house and truck. Another neighbor two doors down also had a pine fall onto their house. But what I was massively unprepared for was the sight two-hundred yards east of me. So many homes were missing roofs and second stories.</span>
        <div class="text-me">
            <p>Me: It's bad</p>

            <span class="time-right">Friday 2:55</span>
        </div>
        <span id="lone">I pull debris from the road so people would stop driving over nails and stack it next to the downed Old Forge stop sign. I’m in shock as I am picking up scraps of wood and shingles from my yard, not knowing what else to do. My neighbor Scott Woolbright heads off down the street to assist others but I am too shaky to be of any help. He tells me the bottom of Old Forge is impassable. Soon, traffic begins to pile up as people become trapped by trees and power lines. I realize getting my wife home may be a problem. I abandon my yard and walk to the end of Reservoir Road and realize it is also impassable.</span>

        <span id="lone1">I didn’t drive but three blocks down the road and was met with a downed pine. It was all pine thanks to their shallow roots and the strong EF3 winds. It had now been preemptively declared an EF3. Shortly after, my wife called and said there was no way she could walk through the damage, it was just took much. I walked back down to Reservoir and saw that the traffic feeding from the top of the hill was moving, slowly, but it was moving. New plan. She would get onto Cantrell and take Reservoir from the top. </span>

        <div id="afternoon-ending">
            <p>What no one tells you about the aftermath of a tornado is the noise. It’s 10:30 at night and I hear a helicopter whirring not so far away as it surveys the damage buried in the darkness below. I want to scream out to the craft that the powerless neighborhood is dependent on the breeze from their open windows and that their noise pollution echoes in with the breeze, all because someone wanted a better view of the carnage. Finally, getting its fill of destruction, the craft moves on, though I remain perched at my bedroom window. </p>
            <p>I hear the chainsaws in the distance. They are removing trees from houses and houses from utilities and utilities from trees. It is a mangled mess in my neighborhood eight hours after being hit by the tornado. What is normally a ten minute commute took my spouse three and a half hours to get home because the neighborhood had been made impenetrable by fallen trees and downed power lines. I replay my experience over and over again in my mind. First the serenity of what I expected to be a sweet and gentle spring storm, then the insane speed at which the tornado hit and left, the experience of the tornado, followed by the trauma of being separated from my only family, it all snowballs and sweeps me away. I recognize this as the beginning of PTSD as I sit next to the window continually taking deep gasps of air while my wife sleeps silently a few feet away.</p>
