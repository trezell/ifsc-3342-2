            <h1>Friday, March 31, 2023</h1>
            <h1>Little Rock, AR</h1>
            <h2>[Friday Morning]</h2>
            <p>The mourning dove embraces the sun-filled morning with it’s gentle trilling coos. The musical beating from it’s special instrumental wings lets me know it has landed for it’s breakfast just outside my open window. I look up to see three doves walking along the patio, their heads bobbing in the direction of the loose seed scattered about. In the distance I can hear the menacing calls of Blue Jays and the comical squeaky-like calls from a Yellow-Bellied Sap-Sucker. I watch a female cardinal hop just out of reach from her male partner as he dances beautifully around her, trying his best to woo her. Their sharp and quick chirps remind me of echolocation and I wonder if they are lovingly singing out their presence to one another. The male abandons his dance when he spots a seed that has fallen from the mouth of a nearby white-breasted nuthatch. I have always found the nuthatch to be a comical little bird. I always imagine them blasting a little trumpet as they march down the tree with their pointy little heads. But my favorite of all birds is the Yellow-shafted Northern Flicker with its tan body and black spotted belly, a black collar, painted black cheeks, red heart-shaped triangle on its nape and black-lined feathers. The Flicker has some of the most amazing markings. I like to believe modern art was hatched from the Flicker.</p>

            </section>
            <p>My birds have personalities which keep it new and entertaining to watch. On hard days I don’t feel so alone and on good days my heart feels as if it takes flight with them. I imagine they take me on little adventures throughout the neighborhood where we evade cats and the deadly Cooper’s hawk that occasionally stalks my feeders. We soar into the spring greening trees and into fruit bearing bushes. They take me along to the feeders put out by fellow birders where I observe the lives of other humans with the same cautious curiosity. My winged imagination soars alongside my birds and I feel the same sense of freedom that only wings can provide. I see the world from above and watch as people scurry about their lives. I see their sheds, gardens, swimming pools, covered boats, and swing sets. I see their passions, their hobbies, their joy.</p>
            <p>The clouds begin to gather as the storm approaches. The sounds of my birds are replaced by the sounds of my wind chimes that are now being gently whipped about by the incoming winds.  In the distance I can hear the thunder beginning to rumble. The feeders suddenly become very popular as birds attempt to get in a good meal before the torrent of rain trees them in their houses and hollows. The birds all eat a bit and leave again and I am alone perched by the window.</p>
            <p>It is mostly silence now, with the occasional call in the distance. The wind chime occasionally catches and belts out her tune but the world is now quiet. There are no cars passing by, there are no squirrels fighting, or birds dancing and cooing; it is the quiet before the storm.</p>

            <span id="lone">I don’t respond to my wife's text. I am grabbing my helmet and dog and getting us into our pantry closet as the sirens and my phone blare their warnings.</span>
            <h2>[Friday 2:25]</h2>
            <span id="tornado">People talk about the tornado sounding like a freight train. I wouldn’t call it a freight train exactly. To me it sounded more like low bass getting louder as it approached. There was a rumble to it, a chaotic static-like rumble that occurred without notice. My dog and I were huddled in our closet shelter. She was sprawled lazily on the floor as I was crouched, hands laced around the closet doorknob. The roar grew louder when suddenly I felt this intense pressure. I felt as if I were in a vacuum. It was a whole body experience. We lost power as I began to hear popping noises and then the pressure became so intense I couldn’t hear anymore. I was deaf and blind and could only feel the house being pulled at. And then, like magic, it was gone. The pressure was gone, all sound was gone, all power was gone, and I was left stunned in the closet, hands still welded to the door knob. There was no doubting what had just happened.</span>
            <div class="text-me">
                <p>Me: Been hit am safe</p>

            </div>
            <span id="lone">I had no idea what awaited me outside. I stayed in my closet for several minutes, afraid of it circling back and finishing the job.</span>

            </div>
            <span id="lone">I emerge shortly after to find damage all around me. My next door neighbors had a gigantic pine fall onto their house and truck. Another neighbor two doors down also had a pine fall onto their house. But what I was massively unprepared for was the sight two-hundred yards east of me. So many homes were missing roofs and second stories.</span>
            <div class="text-me">
                <p>Me: It's bad</p>

            </div>
            <span id="lone">I pull debris from the road so people would stop driving over nails and stack it next to the downed Old Forge stop sign. I’m in shock as I am picking up scraps of wood and shingles from my yard, not knowing what else to do. My neighbor Scott Woolbright heads off down the street to assist others but I am too shaky to be of any help. He tells me the bottom of Old Forge is impassable. Soon, traffic begins to pile up as people become trapped by trees and power lines. I realize getting my wife home may be a problem. I abandon my yard and walk to the end of Reservoir Road and realize it is also impassable.</span>

            <span id="lone">I didn’t drive but three blocks down the road and was met with a downed pine. It was all pine thanks to their shallow roots and the strong EF3 winds. It had now been preemptively declared an EF3. Shortly after, my wife called and said there was no way she could walk through the damage, it was just took much. I walked back down to Reservoir and saw that the traffic feeding from the top of the hill was moving, slowly, but it was moving. New plan. She would get onto Cantrell and take Reservoir from the top. </span>

            <h2>[Friday 10:30]</h2>
            <p>What no one tells you about the aftermath of a tornado is the noise. It’s 10:30 at night and I hear a helicopter whirring not so far away as it surveys the damage buried in the darkness below. I want to scream out to the craft that the powerless neighborhood is dependent on the breeze from their open windows and that their noise pollution echoes in with the breeze, all because someone wanted a better view of the carnage. Finally, getting its fill of destruction, the craft moves on, though I remain perched at my bedroom window. </p>
            <p>I hear the chainsaws in the distance. They are removing trees from houses and houses from utilities and utilities from trees. It is a mangled mess in my neighborhood eight hours after being hit by the tornado. What is normally a ten minute commute took my spouse three and a half hours to get home because the neighborhood had been made impenetrable by fallen trees and downed power lines. I replay my experience over and over again in my mind. First the serenity of what I expected to be a sweet and gentle spring storm, then the insane speed at which the tornado hit and left, the experience of the tornado, followed by the trauma of being separated from my only family, it all snowballs and sweeps me away. I recognize this as the beginning of PTSD as I sit next to the window continually taking deep gasps of air while my wife sleeps silently a few feet away.</p>

            <h2>[Saturday]</h2>
            <p>We went to Walmart to get some ice for our cooler, some charcoal, and some new flashlights. When we got home we raked the backyard and swept off the patio. After we were done my wife started the grill and I started drinking. I was still on edge and the beer was helping to calm my nerves.</p>
            <h2>[Sunday]</h2>
            <p>We skip church and tend to the front yard. We raked it as best as we could and saw to the mammoth Sturbridge Community pool cover that was swept into our raised garden bed. I got a box cutter and cut it into eight three by ten foot sections. We carried it all to the street and placed it on top of the remaining pieces of our shed and fence. She started the grill again and I started drinking again. That evening around seven, power on our side of the street was restored.</p>
            <h2>[Monday]</h2>
            <p>More and more trucks and heavy machinery line the streets making Old Forge essentially a single laned road. The noise is still thick and hard to bear. My wife takes the day off from work. She spends it cleaning the house while I work outside. I get out my pickaxe and take all my anxiety out on the dirt in our flower bed. I cart ten wheelbarrows of dirt before calling it a day. She grills again and I drink again. I started talking about my experience more. The shock started to wear off and I came to realize how close we came to losing everything and how close I came to being sucked up with our belongings.</p>
            <h2>[Tuesday]</h2>
            <p>They said the weather was supposed to get bad again. I reached out to a friend and cried for most of the morning. I was bound up with fear so I decided to dig out my pickaxe again. This time I took my anxiety out on a cubic foot root system I had been trying to dig up the past five years since moving in. I he-manned that old tree right out of the ground and it took every ounce of strength I had. My muscles were screaming but I couldn’t stop there. I grabbed the pruning shears and took out the small tree of my neighbors that she wanted rid of. I planned to attack those roots too but soon realized I had become a wet noodle. But I just couldn’t stop. So I tore down the rest of the mangled fence and hauled it to the street. I’ve realized that I’m not liking being indoors and I’m not sure why. I think it reminds me of being in that claustrophobic closet all hot and sweaty and in the dark. I poured myself a stout drink since I am alone and there is no one to judge me. I finish it outside and come in to take a shower. </p>

            <section id="before">
                <h2>Predisposed to PTSD</h2>
                <p>I can now recognize that I’ve survived something major and that <i>“after an ordeal like a tornado… people often have trouble sleeping and concentrating, feel jumpy and may be easily startled, or see the disaster replaying in their minds.”</i>- <a href=“https://www.govtech.com/em/disaster/tornadoes-aftermath-puts-some-at-risk-for-ptsd.html”>govtech.com</a> I understand that my symptoms have a name, one of which I am no stranger to.</p> 
                <p>Although I am acquainted with PTSD, this is my first time working through it in real-time, as much of my trauma occured during my youth. This early trauma has put me at a greater risk for developing PTSD. According to <a href=“https://www.physio-pedia.com/Post-traumatic_Stress_Disorder”> physio-pedia</a><i>“apart from the event itself, risk factors for developing PTSD include: a past history of trauma or previous mental health problems; ongoing stressful life events after the trauma; an absence of social supports; gender (more prevalent in women); childhood adversities.”</i></p> 
                <p>As a woman with little social support who has mental health problems stemming from childhood adversities and a history of severe trauma, I have a greater risk for developing PTSD.</p>
                <h2>Coping</h2>
                <p>Over the years of recovery from childhood events, I have replaced maladaptive coping mechanisms with positive ones. I know there are healthy and unhealthy ways of coping and I can see myself performing a little of both. I can applaud myself for the good things I am doing while showing myself some grace for the bad things. I am heeding a number of the <a href=“https://www.apa.org/topics/disasters-response/tornadoes”>American Psychological Association’s</a> (APA) recommendations for dealing with PTSD after a tornado. According to the APA it is important to be patient with yourself while you work through your emotions. Another recommendation I am following is to reach out to others by seeking support and/or speaking about your experience. Lastly, I am being physically active and letting off steam that way.”</p>
                <p>Not all of my methods for coping have been positive. One in particular is very troubling. Although I am troubled by this coping mechanism, I also know I am not alone in my issues drinking because according to <a href=“https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/related/problem_alcohol_use.asp”>Veterans Affairs</a> <i>“going through a trauma—whether or not you develop PTSD—can lead to alcohol use problems. Up to three quarters of people who survived abuse or violent traumatic events report drinking problems.”</i></p>
                <section id="va-drinking">                  
                    <p>“You may drink because using alcohol distracts you from your problems for a short time. You should know, though, that drinking makes it harder to concentrate, be productive, and enjoy your life.</p>
                    <p>Using too much alcohol makes it harder to cope with stress and your trauma memories. Alcohol use and intoxication (getting drunk) can increase some PTSD symptoms.</p> 
                    <p>Examples of symptoms that can get worse are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>feeling numb or having no emotions</li>
                            <li>being cut off from others</li>
                            <li>feeling angry and irritable</li>
                            <li>feeling depressed</li>
                            <li>feeling jittery or as if you are always on guard”</li> 
                        </ul>

            <h2>Survivor's Guilt</h2>
            <section id="guilt">
                <p>“Some people may also experience ‘survivor’s guilt,’ which is when you feel guilty that the disaster didn’t affect you as severely as others. Specifically, you may feel guilty that you lived when others did not or that your property was undamaged while others suffered serious damage. These feelings can include exaggerated beliefs about your ability to predict the outcome or feelings of wrongdoing on your part. These feelings can increase the severity of other symptoms of distress following the event.”<a href=“http://extension.msstate.edu/publications/coping-grief-after-disaster”>MSState.edu</a></p>
            </section>
            <p>I’ve put a lot of pressure on myself to be okay after the tornado. Mostly, I feel guilty for having PTSD when our home was barely touched. My beautiful Chevy Silverado 4x4 truck, Petra, now has scratches and dents. Our shed that my wife and I built during her battle with cancer was totaled along with its contents, but our house is still habitable. I have felt guilt for having PTSD when we were mostly unscathed. The more I try to be okay the more I am led to drink. The more I drink, the less I hear the rumble and then the popping, the less I feel the pressure and then the silence. The more I drink, the more I am outside, and the less time I am in quiet darkness remembering the humidity as the sweat poured from my nervous body as it remained crouched, hands welded to the door that wouldn’t stay shut.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ending-2">
            <p>I am not only suffering from the PTSD of a close call with Mother Nature, I am suffering from survivor’s guilt. It’s been ten days and the PTSD is getting better, as are my chosen coping methods, but it is being replaced by survivor’s guilt. I will try to remember <i>“it’s a good idea to simply acknowledge it and call it what it is because it doesn’t go away if one represses these feelings. It’s not about healing the guilt so much as it is about shifting one’s perspective, and the passage of time can help immensely.”</i><a href=“https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-empowerment-diary/201801/what-everybody-should-know-about-survivors-guilt”>-Psychology Today.</a>
