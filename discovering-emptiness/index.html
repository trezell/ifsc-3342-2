    <p>My first Non-fiction writing assignment was entitled “Who am I?” I remember asking myself that question over and over again. It is a complicated question for the average person but I have long past capitulated to being anomalous. I have been significantly warped by consistent traumas that began to abate a mere ten years ago at the age of twenty-five. Trauma is all I’ve ever known and the adjustment to a so-called normal life hasn’t been easy. Finding out who I am beneath all the wounds left behind by those traumas has been the hardest fight of my life. So, who am I?</p>
    <p>I asked my wife if she could think of a time when I demonstrated an exemplary character and without a second’s pause she reminded me of my father’s funeral and how my aunt accurately described me as being noble. I had attended my father’s funeral and never given that day a second thought. Taking a page out of my old tattered book, I shoved that story down like I had all the others. The Who I Am assignment was the first time I used writing to unpack my trauma and it was catching. Not only did I discover I had a natural talent, but I also discovered that with time, writing would gradually pull me out of a major depressive episode.</p>
    <p>Once I made this discovery, writing became a near-daily ritual for me. I could glide easily through surface-level pains or I could drag myself down to the pits of my despair. But it wasn’t until I wrote a seemingly trivial and mundane piece that things began to click for me. I wrote about a typical day in my life, from sunup to sundown. Below is an excerpt.</p>
    <div id="writing">
      I tell myself I’m going to get on the treadmill today, or my stationary bike, but I know I will simply return to my recliner because there is just so much going on in the world; news that leaves clues as to what disaster I must be prepared for. There is so much news to keep up with. News of the war in Ukraine, news of the warnings from China, North Korea, and Russia. There is news of multiple train derailments, massive oil spills, chemicals on fire, and explosive fires in factories around the country. There is news of Congress and its latest sickening displays in our hallowed halls. If we behaved like them at our jobs we would lose them. We, the typical Americans. They, the elitist monsters who exercise inside trading and bleed us dry for their own profit. News of injustice. News of war. News. News! I am traumatizing myself with news. Sometimes I pry myself away long enough to go into my office and catch an online class. I’ve chosen online classes because I never have to leave the house. I won’t be caught outside when the Russians blast their emp weapons and bring America back to the Stone Age. I won’t be caught outside when North Korea sends a barrage of missiles. I will take an F in the one course where physical attendance is required. I stay at home where I am safe and sheltered, and where I would die happily in our perfect home that I designed and manufactured. Some would call this behavior agoraphobia but I just call it being safety-minded. I’ve convinced myself that everything with me is okay, it’s the world one must worry about, and so my limited world interaction is justified.
    </div> 
    <p>After I wrote this piece, I kept coming back to it. I saw my current existence in writing and it scared me. It scared me more than leaving the house did. So I took a baby step and banned myself from looking at the news. Instead, I spent time writing and catching up on the classes I had missed. I forced myself to make little trips to the store at least once per week. It was slow going.</p>
    <p>The more I wrote, the more I felt and unpacked. Some days were very dark and full of tequila. Days such as the one in which I wrote “I can sense myself leaving my body but I stay long enough to feel my father slowly lifting my leg and placing a battalion of skin between them.” It was a dark but necessary day. The darker my pages grew, the brighter I became. I can’t say that writing has saved my life but it has dramatically improved it. Writing helped me to realize that I wasn’t living, I was hiding. Writing has made me brave and with this bravery, I want to share all my hope with other survivors.</p>
