            <h1>Friday, March 31, 2023</h1>
            <h1>Little Rock, AR</h1>
            <h2>[Friday Morning]</h2>
            <p>The mourning dove embraces the sun-filled morning with it’s gentle trilling coos. The musical beating from it’s special instrumental wings lets me know it has landed for it’s breakfast just outside my open window. I look up to see three doves walking along the patio, their heads bobbing in the direction of the loose seed scattered about. In the distance I can hear the menacing calls of Blue Jays and the comical squeaky-like calls from a Yellow-Bellied Sap-Sucker. I watch a female cardinal hop just out of reach from her male partner as he dances beautifully around her, trying his best to woo her. Their sharp and quick chirps remind me of echolocation and I wonder if they are lovingly singing out their presence to one another. The male abandons his dance when he spots a seed that has fallen from the mouth of a nearby white-breasted nuthatch. I have always found the nuthatch to be a comical little bird. I always imagine them blasting a little trumpet as they march down the tree with their pointy little heads. But my favorite of all birds is the Yellow-shafted Northern Flicker with its tan body and black spotted belly, a black collar, painted black cheeks, red heart-shaped triangle on its nape and black-lined feathers. The Flicker has some of the most amazing markings. I like to believe modern art was hatched from the Flicker.</p>

            <p>My birds have personalities which keep it new and entertaining to watch. On hard days I don’t feel so alone and on good days my heart feels as if it takes flight with them. I imagine they take me on little adventures throughout the neighborhood where we evade cats and the deadly Cooper’s hawk that occasionally stalks my feeders. We soar into the spring greening trees and into fruit bearing bushes. They take me along to the feeders put out by fellow birders where I observe the lives of other humans with the same cautious curiosity. My winged imagination soars alongside my birds and I feel the same sense of freedom that only wings can provide. I see the world from above and watch as people scurry about their lives. I see their sheds, gardens, swimming pools, covered boats, and swing sets. I see their passions, their hobbies, their joy.</p>
            <p>The clouds begin to gather as the storm approaches. The sounds of my birds are replaced by the sounds of my wind chimes that are now being gently whipped about by the incoming winds.  In the distance I can hear the thunder beginning to rumble. The feeders suddenly become very popular as birds attempt to get in a good meal before the torrent of rain trees them in their houses and hollows. The birds all eat a bit and leave again and I am alone perched by the window.</p>
            <div id="morning-end">
                <p>It is mostly silence now, with the occasional call in the distance. The wind chime occasionally catches and belts out her tune but the world is now quiet. There are no cars passing by, there are no squirrels fighting, or birds dancing and cooing; <span id="storm"><strong>it is the quiet before the storm.</strong></span></p>
