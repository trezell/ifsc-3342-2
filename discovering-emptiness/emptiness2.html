            <div class="scene1-start">
                <p>A dark doorway opens wide before me, revealing a strange but familiar wilderness.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="scene1-2">
                <p> The wilderness gives birth to a lonely and nearly naked Emptiness who begins to dance around me, her black velvet cape twirling, as she beckons me to follow. Succumbing to the melancholic descant, I stumble hypnotized out of the clean porcelain box from which I am currently sprawled and enter into the dirty depths of my mind. Emptiness cries out for me to extinguish my firelight and join her by the riverside where the spirits of madness roam freely. Like magic, I am stripped of all hope as the familiar suffocating feeling settles over this gorge of darkness in which I am now a willing prisoner. I sit in the cold mud deep within the valley, the valley that exists only in my mind, for my body is actually crumpled on the bathroom floor. Emptiness looks at my deep blue veins and cries out for homage. She yearns for something to make her feel alive, so she screams to be painted red but I cannot. It has been nearly ten years since I have crafted a weapon in this bush and provided for her the panacea she most craves. If she doesn’t quiet soon I will drink her into oblivion.</p>

        <div class="scene2">
            <div class="scene2-1">
                <p>I take a deep breath and gaze upon myself once more. I can see it in my eyes, my desire to make Emptiness go away. My old friends self-harm, food, hydrocodone, and pot are long gone and so I am stuck with my remaining two options: Tequila or working out. With little warning, I slam my hands onto the marble vanity, vexed by my limited options. How I wish I could curl up beside Emptiness with a bottle of hydrocodone but I’m in Recovery and it bloody well pisses me off! “Recovery.” I laugh because I’m not an addict, I lie. “Recovery” but Tequila is still legal until it becomes a problem. It’s not yet a problem. “Let’s not make it a problem,” I say, giving in to the notion of movement.</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="fade-in-section">
                <p>I turn away from Emptiness, though she still ambles close behind me</p>
            </div>
            <div class="scene2-2">
                <p>and make my way to my wardrobe to change into my workout clothing. From my dresser, I pull out my black Under Armour basketball shorts and a bright orange off-brand racerback. Sitting on the unmade bed I slip on a pair of orange SmartWool socks before heading into the kitchen to fill up a sixty-four-ounce aqua flip-top water bottle.</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="scene2-3">
                <p>Once in my home gym, I slip on my Hoka running shoes and hook up the Bluetooth sound system to my phone. I open Spotify and pass by my typical dance gym mix choosing instead to listen to my playlist full of artists like In This Moment, Lacuna Coil, and Butcher Babies. They play songs like “Blood,” “Trip the Darkness,” and “Headspin,” all adequate expressions of my current emotional state. With my music well in hand, I mount my stationary bicycle and let the music fuel me as I ravage my body.</p>

        <div class=”scene3-1”>
            <p>Aggression drips from the words <q>“blood, blood, blood, pump mud through my veins, shut your dirty, dirty mouth, I’m not that easy”</q> and chokes me as the guitar screams and the angry woman from In This Moment screeches out her woes from behind the speaker. I let her rage fill me as I pump my legs up and down in hot pursuit of that searing burn. My hands make tight fists around the handlebars until my knuckles are devoid of color and begin to ache. I don’t need to look at my instruments to know I am sustaining seventeen miles per hour because I can feel my sides moaning from exertion and I know that indisputable stitch is soon in coming. Time seems to vanish and before I know it I have ridden eight miles.</p>
